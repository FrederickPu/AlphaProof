# AlphaProof

Aim to make an open source replication of the AlphaProof paper

## road to and past AlphaProof

In addition to replicating AlphaProof we aim to hit some other ai theorem proving landmarks along the way as well as some additions.
- pretrain a SLM (small language model) on lean4 code (eg proof-pile-2).
- RAG (retrevial augmented) SLM for premise selection and integrate with Lean Copilot
- RL based self-supervised curriculumn based theorem proving using MCTS/rmax (alpha proof paper)
- few shot curriculumn based theorem proving on utm undergraduate math content (mat137/mat139, mat157/mat159/mat257, csc236)
